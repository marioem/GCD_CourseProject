#
# This script is aimed at generating tidy data set from the data collected during
# the project "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set". It forms
# part of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project offered by JHU through
# Coursera.com. More data about the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
# Data Set" project can be foud at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#
#
# According to instructions set out in the course project description, this script
# does the following:
#
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
#    measurement. 
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
#    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#
#         Input: the original data structure extracted from 
#                https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
#                into the working directory, where also this script should
#                be present.
#        Output: file "UCItidyDataMeans.txt" stored in "UCI HAR Dataset" directory
#     Execution: run this script from your current working directory using 
#                source("run_analysis.R")
# Prerequisites: 1) this script is located in your current working directory
#                2) UCI HAR Dataset is extracted from the downloaded zip file
#                   into your current working directory. This would result in a
#                   "UCI HAR Dataset" data directory in current working directory.
#                3) System which this script is run upon does not require escaping
#                   of the spaces in the filenames passed to R functions
#                4) dplyr package is installed on your system
#
# The tidy data set is written using write.table function with row.names = FALSE.
# It can be read back using
#        read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/UCItidyDataMeans.txt", header = T)
